\section{Introduction to Cloud Computing and Container Orchestration Frameworks}

\onehalfspacing

\subsection{Enterprise IT}

2019, in Enterprise IT, Cloud Computing is the new norm\footnote{Vgl. \textit{Gartner (2019)}: Cloud computing is the new norm \cite{gartnerCloudStatement}} according to Gartner Research, and is expected to grow even further\footnote{Vgl. \textit{Gartner (2019)}: Gartner Forecasts Worldwide Public Cloud Revenue \cite{gartnerForecast}}

After a decade of virtualization, cloud computing now focuses on Containerization

Enterprise virtualization with a self-service portal is not cloud computing

\subsection{Container Run-time}

Docker pioneered the single node container run-time

To orchestrate more than one node, you'll need an orchestration framework; here are the most popular:
\begin{itemize}
\item Docker Swarm
\item Kubernetes
\item Mesos DC/OS
\end{itemize}

After Mirantis acquired the Docker Enterprise business, it announced the end of life for Docker Swarm\footnote{Vgl. \textit{Mirantis (2019)}: What We Announced Today and Why it Matters \cite{mirantisDocker}}; Mesos DC/OS never gathered a large following, so now only Kubernetes remains as an container orchestration framework with a sizeable installed base.

In this text we'll have a look at the challenges posed by introducing a Container Orchestration Framework into Enterprise IT and showcase a possible solution.
